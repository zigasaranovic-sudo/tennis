# Ralph Progress Log
Started: initial setup

## Codebase Patterns
- Quality check command: `pnpm --filter @tenis/web build` — must pass zero errors
- Supabase joins like `player1:player1_id(...)` return SelectQueryError types — always cast with `as unknown as LocalType[]`
- Json type from Supabase DB types is recursive — use `as unknown as YourType` to unwrap score_detail etc.
- All web UI must have dark: Tailwind variants. Standard mapping: bg-white→dark:bg-slate-800, text-gray-900→dark:text-slate-100, border-gray-200→dark:border-slate-700
- Mobile dark mode uses useColorScheme() from react-native + inline style objects (NOT dark: NativeWind variants)
- tRPC router registration: add to packages/api/src/root.ts, export from there
- score_detail shape: [{p1: number, p2: number}] — one entry per set
- No ELO displayed in UI anywhere (still stored in DB, never shown to users)
- pnpm workspace: always use `pnpm --filter @tenis/web build` not `cd apps/web && pnpm build`
- Git: commit with `feat: [STORY-ID] - [Story Title]` then `git push`
